is always used. For past time the perfect or historica] present is always
used, although English is apt to use the pluperiect. See 198, α, l. The
conjunctions are postquam, asten· ut, ubi, when (in the sense ol after, not
in the sense ol while) simulac, cum primum, aa soonasjimmedmlclyafler).
(Cum with the pluperlect subjunctive has the same meaning.) Example:
ubi certiores facti sunt, legatos mittunt (Caes. 1, 7, 7), when they were
informet of lt they sent envoys.
Oum

238. Cum, when, is a relative adverb or conjunction, as is shown by
its original lorm quom. The use of modes with itis much the same ar
with the declined relative. Its antecedent is a word ol time, sometimes
expressed, usually understood, in the principal clause. Besides the

meaning wlcan, it has taken on the meanings since (causal) and althouph
adversative).

239. Causal and adversative cum is used with the subjunctive of all
tenses. Compare the causal relative (245) and adversative relative (247).
Examples: quae cum ita sint, perge (Cic. Cat. 1, 10), aare thisis so, poem·
his cum persuadere non possent, legatos mittunt (Caes. I, 9, 3), aiace
they could aot permade them they sent envoya- cum ad vesperum
pugnatum sit (Caes. 1, 26, 5), olthoayh they foayht riu merelay.

240. An inaccurate, but convenient, statement lor temporal cum
(when) is as follows: temporal cum is generally used with the subjunctive
oi the imperfect and pluperfect tenses when the principal verb is past,
always with the indicative ol the other tenses when the principal verb
is present or future. See examples under 241 and 242, which give
more accurate statements lor the same clauses.

241.1ndicativsclauses. The indicative is used with temporal
eum in the following clauses:

a. Clouees os dole. These are used strictly to tell witot time (not
cobet lind oi time), and correspond exactly¹ to determining relative
clauses (231). (But a subjunctive is often found where an indicative
might be expected.) Example: cum caesar in Galliam venit, prin·
cipes erant Aedui (Caes. VI, 12, 1), at the time when Cacsar come io Gaul
the Aedui were the leaders. Compare cum esset (Caes. ΙΙ, 1, 1) which
seems almost the same thought.

b. Generaliziny(conclitioaal) clauses. In these cum means ammon.
They correspond exactly to conditional relative clauses (250). (The
subjunctive issometimes used in them. See 242, b.) Example: haec
