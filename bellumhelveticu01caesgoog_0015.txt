be required throughout all the lessons. 'lhe shorter Latin-
English exercises should be translated at hearing as the teacher
pronounces the words.

4. 'lhe principles and facts 01 the notes should be thoroughly
learned and recited. Although frequent references are made to
the same principle, it should nothe necessary for the student
to occupy his time in· turning to the first explanation.

5. Drill thor-oughly and constantly on the paradigms. Do
not be satisfied until the student can run through theru as rapidly
as he can the alphabet. The student finds translation more
interesting, and sees that it is possible to translate short bits 01
Latin with the help 01 the vocabulary, and without much knowl-
edge 01 paradigms. If 101 any reason the teacher allows him to
neglect the paradigms, he does him an injury from which hc can
never fully recover. At the end 01 the first year the student
should know the forms perfec ly. 11 110 does not he will never
learn thern and will never handle Latin with accuracy.

6. In translating‚ the student should be taught 10 ascertain
the thought in the Latin order, and first render the words one by
one as they stand in the text, noting the grammatica] form 01
each word and all its possible constructione. Thus, rm rebus

order, is 10 take a sentence (the teacher giving the meaning 01
the first form 01 unfamiliar words) aud write it on the black-
board one word at a time, calling upon the student to give the
meaning, word by word, as the sentence progresses. Here the
student should be taught 10 think 01 the possible constructione .
