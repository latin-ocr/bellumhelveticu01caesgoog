commanded thol deponite, is a past command to praise in a time future to
the past, though it may be now really past. The perfect subjunctive in
this use is often nearly the same as the present subjunctive, though not
so often used

201. The following table shows the meanings of the subjunctive
tenses.

Present '= present or future

Imperfect = imperfect or future to a past

Perfect = perfect or future perfect (or future)
Pluperfect = pluperfect or future perfect to a past

a. Some of these tenses have developed special meanings in certain
constructione. See 221, 226, and 254. .

b. Since the present has a future meaning as well as a present, and
the perfect has a future perfect meaning as well as a perfect, the sub-
junctive needs no special forms for the future and future perfect. But
where the meaning would be doubtful and it is necessary to express the
future clearly, the periphrastic tenses are used.

202. When a subjunctive clause depende on some, other clause, a
little thinking about the real meaning of the English will enable one to
use the right tense, just as in the indicative. When the ten'ses mean
the same as those of the indicative they will be used in the same way
(197, 198). When they have the future set of meanings, it will be
found that a present or perfect is usually required after a tense of
present or future meaning, and the imperfect and pluperfect after one of
past meaning. For example: I come, orI shall come, llinl I moy pratae,
laudem3 I conae thot I might proin, laudarem. In the subjunctive the
usage is more regular than in the indicative, so that the convenient but
not very accurate rulo, called the rule of sequence of tenses, can be
followed. ,

Rule: In dependent subjunctive clauses principal tenses follow
principal, and historical follow historical.

203. Principal tenses are those which have to do with the present
and future, historical are those which have to do with the past. The
following table of examples shows which are the principal and which
the historical tenses of both indicative and subjunctive.
