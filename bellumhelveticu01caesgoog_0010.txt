’ Tun experience of many teachers has proved the excellence of
the Bellum Helveticum. It hasbeen found interesting and
stirnulating to both toachers and classes during the actual time
of using the book; and the advantage of having used it appears

classroom, -the reviser has attempted to hold fast to the original
plan and purpose of the book. Its leading features have been
retained unchanged, and may be described for the most part in

Gallie War (up to the end of the Helvetian War) is used as pre-

and structure for the beginner. lt affords an illustration of the
most important principles of the language, and prepares the
student for a further study of Caesar. After thoroughly learn-

to memoriae the text for a few lessons, for the purpose of secur-

ing a model for the order of words and of fixing the pronun
