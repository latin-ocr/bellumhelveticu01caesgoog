SECOND ΟΟΝδυΘΑΤΙΟΝ

272. The characteristic oi the second conjugation is δ. This e does not
unite with the ending -ὃ astho thoi the first conjugation does. Otherwise a
simple substitution ot t tor the stem vowel a makes the only difference

between the tenses based on the present stem (see 264) in the second conju-

gation and the same tenses in the first conjugation.
The infinitivo ends in -ere When this is given in the principat parts the

verb is known to be ot the second conjugation.

273. The perfect stem is usually formed by substituting u ior the final J
vowel oi the present stem; 11 11 moneo, l worn: present stem, mone, Ῑ
perfect stem, monu-. But this is not true ot all words ; therefore the prin-
cipnl parts must be learned so well that they will come to mind without
effort. ln all verbs oi all conjugatione the tenses based on the perfect stem

(see 265) are formed exactly as in laudo.
