o. Notice that the perfect subjunctive, even when it means past time,
is called a principal tense.

204. Exceptions to Rule of sequence. Two special points must
be mentioned, not hard to understand if one remembers that this rule
tells only how the natural meanings of the tenses make them depend on
each other, and that the Romans probably did not even know that they
had such a rule.

a. An exception may occur whenever the meaning of the sentence
makes it natural. still, Latin is not fond of these exceptione, andil
exceptional tenses must be used it is better to use an indicative con· i
struction instead of a subjunctive, when there is achoioe. Forexample,
if the sentence, ive murchad around because the mouatoiaa arc Ilipla, is to l
be put into Latin, cum sint would be an exception to sequence and it is ᾖ
better to use the indicative construction quod eunt. The most common ¹
exceptions are in result clauses, where a perfect sometimes follows a
perfect. Exempla, singulas nostri expugnaverunt, ut perpaucae ad
terram pervenerint (Caes. ΠΙ, 15, 11), our mea took them one by one, ao
thot very few reached laod. ³

t. A subjunctive following an historical present may be either κ
principal or historical, for it may either keep up the liveliness of the ]
present or behave as if the perfect had been used. Examples: diem ’
dicunt qua dis conveniant (Caes. I, 6,15), they appoint a day Ι on ¹
