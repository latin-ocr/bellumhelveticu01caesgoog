neeustomed, attempt, bepin, eenee, determine, oopltt, otah, and the like. Some
of these verbs are intransitive ; with others the infiniti ve may be regarded
as taking the place oi a direct object. Examplee: ire potest, tte cao po,-
ire potuit, lie could tiore pone, literally he arna oble to pa· constituerunt
comparare (Caes. 1, 3, 2), they determined to prepare.

a. As these verbs have no subject accusative, either expressed or
understood, a predicate noun or adjective must agree with the nomina· ,
tive subiect oi the principal verb. Example: fortis esse conatur, lte
trn'es to be broce

276. The infinitivo without an expressed subject accusative may be
used as the subject of such impersonal verbs as decet, libet, lieet,
oportet, placet, and ot eet in such expressionsas neeesse eet, satie est.
(The infinitivo with these verbs osten has an expressed accusative sub-
ject. See 278.) Examples: ire oportet, one ranst po, literally to po tr right·
ire oportuit, one cupiet to ltere pone (205, α), literally to po rrae replet· ei
ire licuit, he mipltt hore porte, literally to po wne perroitted to irim.

a. Asubject accusative is easily supplied in thought with these infini-
tives, and a predicate noun or adjective is regularly in the accusative.
But licet governs the dative and the predicate is usually dative.
Examples: fortem esse oportet, one oupltt to hebreae-viro licet esse forti,
a mort arey be broce, literally r't ia perrottted to o mna to te broce.

tive clause (186).

hove pone (205, α).

ΙΝΡΙΝΙΤΝΕ CLAUSE As OBdECT

279. The most common use of the infinitivo clause is as the object
oi verbs which mean either to aseertoin a saet or to haee knowledpe of a
fact or to mulce ascet tanen. All tenses of the infinitivo are used. This
lethe indirect discourse construction. For examples see 205 and 266.

α. When these verbs are made passive either the person'al construc-
tion or the impersonal is possible 3 but the personal is the inore common,
except with a lew such expressions as dietum est, tt ltus tren sold.
