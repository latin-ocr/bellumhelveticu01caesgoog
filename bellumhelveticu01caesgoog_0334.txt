a. Therefore such forms as eeeiny, usually, and such forms as beiny
scen, always, must be translated into Latin otherwise than by a present
participle.

1. They are often used where the action is really completed before
the action of the verb: Latin then uses the perfect participle. For
example: eeeiny thielae fled, means homey aem, etc, and may be trans·
lated hbe vise (150) frigit ¹

2. They are very often used where Latin uses dum with the present
indicative (234, e,) or cum with the imperfect (or pluperfect) subiunc-
tive (242, e). Examples: de wer ldtted (while) flyletiey, either dum
pugnat occisus est, or cum pugnaret occisus est; seeiny this he fled,
cum hdo vidisset fugit

b. Remember that he ismeniae is always currit, never est currens.

pratee Caesar, literally, Caesermest be praised by me· mihi pdgnandum
fuit (impersonal), I lead tofiyld, literali y e't laed to beseuylit by me.

b. The gerundive is sometimes used, to denote purpose, in agreement
with the objeets of verbs meaning lo leuce (a thing done) or to undertulce
(to do a thing); especially cdrd, haee (literally take curel, dc, pice over,
suscipis), andertete. Examples: pontem faciendum cdrat (Caes. I, 13,
2), he hes a bridye incede: censulibus senatus rem publicam defenden-
dam dedit, tbe senate attracted the defense of the eleeto the emacula
