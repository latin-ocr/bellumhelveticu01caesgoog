172. The endings of the perfect indicative active are:

srncunnlt rhaithu

Irtpersca -i ¹ ·imus
ad person deti -istis
dd person -it -erunt

173. All verbs oi all conjugatione use these same endings in the perfect,
though they do not all form their perfect stems in the same way. Hereafter
the perfect of any verb can be inflected when the stem is given. For in·
staura, the perfect stem of the verb to ba is fu-. The tense is inflected as
follows:

circuunt rhenan

1. fui, Iwas fuimus, wawere ,
2. fuisti, you were fuistis, you were
3. fuit, he, etc, was fuerunt, they were

174. Verbs of the first conjugation regularly form the perfect stem by
adding v to the present stem. Remember that in this conjugation the
present stem ends in d, though the first person ends in ὃ. So, laudi -l-
v = laudam, the perfect stem.

surdum PLURAB

1. laudavi, Ipraised laudavimus, we praised

2. laudavisti, you praised laudavistis, you praised

3. laudavit, he, etc, praised laudaverunt, they praised
Inflect the perfecta of commeo, importv'), spectd.
