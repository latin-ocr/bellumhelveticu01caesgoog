133. The i ol the stem unites vvith the endings‚ appearlng in some oi
the cases, but apparently lost iri others. Theoretically‚ the i should appear
in all cases except the nominative and vocative plural ol masculines and
femininos. This will be seen in the deciension of turris, m, lowen which is
given ior comparison with the consonant stem princeps, rr„ chief!

134. Notice the accusative singular in -im. the ablative in -ῑ, and the
accusative plural in -is. But notice, too, that the other tornis are used aa
vvell. These arethe troublesome cases, for there was no fixed rule about
them, and in some words the Romans preferred one form, in others the
other. It is usually saie to use the forms cm, ·e‚ and -es ior masculine and
feminine i-stems

135. Notice that in the nominative and vocative singular, and the geni-
tive plural, the endings oi prInceps and turris are really thesaure, since
the i in turris and turrium belongs to the stem. But it is more conven-
ient to speak oi the endings as ·ie and ium, and they are so printed in the
iollovving paradigma.
