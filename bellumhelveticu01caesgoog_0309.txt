detail, telling something that was going on at the time of the main
· event, planned, and must be imperfect in Latin, though English uses the

l

simple past tense. Or he might prefer to begin in this way, “The κ

Helvetians, who lived .......... had planned ......... . But Caesar went.”
Then ruent is thought ol as the first main event, and is the only perfect;
lived is still i1nperfect; but hod planted is thought of as a subordinate
detail, giving something which had happened before the went and which
led up to it. Itis, therefore, apluperfect.

dependent clauses use the imperfect and pluperfect.

199. Latin is very accurate in the use of the future and future per-
fect, while English is very inaccurate. In many subordinate clauses
English uses the present for the future or the future perfect, while
Latin uses the tense required hythe meanings. For an example ωε

200. The tenses of the subjunctive seem to have two sets ofmean-
rngs.

a. Where the subjunctive has the same meaning as the indicative
(184, c), the tenses of the subjunctive mean the same as the cone-
sponding tenses of the indicative.

b. Where the subjunctive has one of its other meanings (184, a, b)
the actis future to thetime of the verb. Laudat, let him proice, is a
present command to praise in the future; imperavit ut laudaret, he
