511, Ithas already been learned that the accusative and infinitive construc-
tlon must be used aiter verbs oi supino or thinking. Now whenever “ he says ’³
or “he thinks '⁵ is used with an object clause, some one's words or thoughts
are being quoted. This may be done in two ways.- lte says “I will come,’'
or he says tuat lte will cotue. ln the former sentence the men's exact words
are used; thetis, he is quoted dtrcclly, or in direct discourse5 in the latter
the substance oi what ho says ls given, not in his exact words, but with a
change oi construction ; thetis, he is quoted indireclly, or in indirect dis-
course. Il the student hus thoroughly understood what hasbeen said about
the tenses oi the infinitive, he has mastered the chief difficulty of indirect
discourse. When an English sentence is to be put into Latin, stop and
think what the original words oi the quoted sentence must have been.
'Phen use the tense oi the infinitive that corresponds to the original tense
used by the speaker, and it will be right. For example, in lte said ctat
he coos rtet, the original words must have been Ι am rich; so the present
infinitivo is right. ln lte sold thot hc hod bees rich, the original words
might have been 1 hooc been (Latin perfect) rich, 1 was (Latin perfect) rich,
or 1 zoua (Latin imperfect) rich. All those are past in time an'd the perfect
infinitivo is the only past infinitivo, so it is right. ln lte sold that he would
be rich, the original words were Ι shall be rich, and the future infinitivo is
right.

512. One other thing must be remembered. Wherever the original
speaker used a persoual or possessive pronoun of the first person (that is,
when he said 1, wc, os, my, our, etc.) the indirect discourse uses some form
of sui or suue; for the other persons, it uses some form ol is or some other
demonstrative. For example, if heroys thot lte is rich stands for Ι om
rich, se esse must be used ; it it stands for he lo rich, eum esse.
