33. In English the form of a noun rused as object is not different from
that oi the same noun used as subject. Examples ι The Oelts (subj.) proice
the Raptam (obj.) ; the Belgicus (suhi.) praue the deus (obj). But in some
pronouns there is a nominative case ior the subject and an objective case
for the object. Examples: I (nom.) protae him (obj.) 3 hc (nom.) praiaco
me (obj). In Latin the objectiva case is called the accusative, and its end-
ing is usually different from that oi the nominative. Examples2001ta0 ,
(nom.) Belgis (aco.)1audant,taeoanpratse ibe Belgicus· Belgae (nom.)
Celtas (acc.) laudant, the Bclyians praue tha Gclts. Such change oi
ending is called decleusion.

34. In English it is necessary to show which word is subject and which is
object by the order. In Latin the endings show which is which, ηο matter
what the order may be. One may say celtae Belgas laudant, Belgis
Celtae laudant, or Belgas laudant Celtae, and yet always show that
Celtae is the subject„ Belgis the object.
