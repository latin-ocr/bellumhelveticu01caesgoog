LATIN-ENGLISH VOCABULARY

Iu this vocabulary the declension of nouus is indicated hy the
ending oi the genitive. The figures l, 2, and 4, after verbs, indicate
that the principal parts are formed like those of laudo, moneo, and
auditi, respectively. If the principal parts are otherwise formed they
are given in full. The supine in -um is given as the fourth form,
although the nominative singular masculine of the perfect passive parti-
. ciple is now more commonly given. It is true that tho supine of many
verbs is not found in extant literature; but the nominative masculine of
the perfect passive participle from intransitive verbs (e. g. ventus) is
not even theoretically possible Furthermore, there seems to he no
iustification for including a passive form among the active principal

parts.
