133. ΑΒΙΑΤΙΙΙΕ

· The language lrorn which Latin developed had two more cases than
Latin has—the instrumental and the locative. The true ablative
meant separation (from), the instrumental meant association or instru-
ment (arith or by), and the locative meant place where (in). The forms
oi these three cases united in the Latin ablative; so that this one
ν case has meanings which belonged to three separate cases.

, 134. Ablative ¹of Separation. Separation is usually expressed by
the ablatire, either alone or with ab, de, or ex. With some verbs both
constructione are used; the individual usage oi others mustbe noted.
For the s0·called dative ol separation see 116, 1. Examples: siris finibus
’ eos prohibent (Caes. 1‚1,14), they repel thera from liwir own temam,-
quae hostem a pigna prohiberent (Caes. 1V,84, 10), 1111111 kept tle
enemy frma baille· eBibracte aberat (Caes. Ι, 23, 3), he was dntamfrom
Bibracte.

α. Ploce from calciet: with verbs expressing motion 2-

1. Plnce from which is regularly expressed by the ablative with a
proposition. Compare 131 and 151. Examples: ut de linibus suis
exirent (Caes. I, 2, 4), 1ο po outsrom 1111112111οω quiex provincii

,convenerant (Caes. I, 8, 2), who had pothoni from lla province.

2. But no preposition is used with names oi towns and small
islands, or with dom6,srom home. Yet ab is used with names oi towns

b. With verbs meaning (imave, free, be 1111110111, and the like, and with
adjectivae oi similar meanings, the ablative without a preposition is

you will free me of preat sena· proelio abstinebat (Caes. Ι, 22, 12), refused
battle (literally abatnimd from baille). ·

135. Ablative oi Sonrce. The ablative2usually without a prep
osition, is used with the participles nitus and ortus, to express
