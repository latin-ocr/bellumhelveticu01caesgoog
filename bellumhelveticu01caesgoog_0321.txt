2³5. Coniunctions meaning 'uritil show that the action of the principal

clause lasted up to that ol the subordinate clause. The action of the

subordinate clause is therefore subsequent to that ol the principal clause.

, Sometimes the actor in the principal clause ioresees the second act and

intends to bring it about, or prepares ior it, and sometimes he does not.
This is the basis for the distinction in the use of modes.

a. Dum, denso, and quoad, until, are used with the indicative when l
the subordinate actis not represented as foreseen. The perfect is l
regularly used for past time. Example: Galli fuerunt liberi dum ¹
(laesar venit, tlte Gnate were free urnii Caesar nime.

b. The sameconjunctions are used with the subjunctive when the i

subordinate act is represented as foreseen.. Examples: Galli exspec- ¹
tavdnmt dum Caesar veniret, the Goth wuited aedil Caesar shordd come, l

ordinate clause as subsequent to that ol the principa] clause, and the i
principle on which the choice ol modes is based is the same as that ³
given in 235.

a. Priusquam and antequam, before, are used with the indicative
when the subordinate act is not represented as loreseen. The perfect is
regularly used for past time. Example: Galliinter se pugnaverim
priusquam (fassas venit, the Gauii fought with one another bp‘tre Caeni
came.

b. The same coniunctione are used with the subjunctive when the
subordinate act is represented as ioreseen. Example: Galli magnis
copias comparare conati sunt priusquam Caesar veniret, the Gaulo
tried to prepare lerpe forces before Caesar ehmrlcl unice, or onived.

c. These conjunctione are often written as two words, the prius or
ante standing in the principal clause, and the quam at the beginning ol
the subordinate c'leuse. Translate as ii the complete word stood where
quam does. Example: Galli prius inter se pugnaverint quam
(fassar venit, translated as in a.

After

237. Coniunctions meaning oster represent the subordinate act as
taking place before the act of the principal clause. There is therefore no

chance ior the choice of modes found in 235 and 236, and the indicative
