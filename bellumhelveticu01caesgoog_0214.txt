Exteolsts

1. Caesar was informed that Dumnorix had led the Helve-
tians through the tenitories of the Sequanians. 2. He had
done all these things without his order and also without the

knowledge of the Aeduans. 3. Having learned these things,
he determined to punish him because he thought there was
sufficient cause. 4. The remarkable devotion and rectitudo
oi his brother Diviciacus opposed this. 5. Caesar feared
that the punishment of Dumnorix would wound the feelings
ot his brother. 6. Diviciacus was called in order that he
might speak with him. 7. Valerius, the interpreter, was not
removed with the other interpreters. 8. Caesar besought
and urged Diviciacus, after examining the case (att. aba),
either himself to decide or to order the state to decide. 9.
He learned that the punishment was without their knowl-
edge or order.
