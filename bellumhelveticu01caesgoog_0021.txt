7. There are no silent letters in Latin. Every word has as
many syllables as it has vowels or diphthongs. In English
mace is one syllable, in Latin mane is two syllables, mane.

8. A single consonant between two vowels goes with the
second vowel, as in mane.

9. When two consonants stand together as in iste and inde,
the rule usually given is: y'oin both consonants with the fol-
lowing vowel if they can be pronounced together3 otherwise
they should be divided. So, iste, inde. But this rulo is seldom
observed in practice, and is not theoretically right, since it makes
incomprehensible the length of syllables.1 The better rule is:
separate any combination oi consonants except a mute followed
by aliquid (b, c, d, g, k, p, q, t, ch, ph, th, followedby l or r).
This is the natural pronunciation: iste and doc-tus are easiar
than i-ste and doetus3 but patris is easier than pat-ris.

Ιο, Α doubled consonant, as in mitto and onnus, is to be
divided in the same way, mitto. and annus, and both parts are
to be sounded. No doubled consonante are pronounoed in Eug- ἦ
lish except in compound words There is no difference in sound ³
between c and cn iu croy and penny ,· but in perc-Iccifc we hear i
two w's The last example illustrates the way in which the l
Romans pronounced all doubled consonants. l

ΙΙ. Syllables are long or short, according to the time taken
in pronouncing them.
