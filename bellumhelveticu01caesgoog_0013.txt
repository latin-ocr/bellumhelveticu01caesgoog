on grammatical points as well as on the subject matter of the
text. In the revised book the questions on grammatical points
have been omitted, but the rest have been retained, usually in
the original form. If used at all they are for impromptu class-
10010 work, and the teacher can explain new words or construc-
tione. For this reason notes are not given on them, but for the
convenience of those who wish to make occasional use of Latin
conversation the glossary 01 unusual words has been retained at
the end of the book.

The Appendix has been rewritten almost entirely. What
needs to be said 01 it is said in its introductory note. It is
hoped that the student will be encouraged to consult it freely,
especially during the later lessons. it is intended to be of
especial service in syntectical matters. Only the essential facts
of syntax are explained in connection with the lessons. Less
important details must be looked for in the Appendix.

' . Some toachers have preferred to use the book only until those

things were learned which were absolutely necessary to the read-
ing of Caesar, and then to take up a complete edition of that
author. With this in mind the reviser has made afew changes
in the order 01 presentation and believes that the complete
edition oi Caesar can be taken up satisfactorily at the end 01
Lesson LXXII. .

. ¹ A general English-Latin vocabulary has been added at the
end of the book. It is believed, however, that 110 words are used Ι
111 the exercises which have not previously been given in the
vocabularies of the lessons.

The work of revision has been very materially assisted by
suggestions from many teachers, for whose kindness hearty
thanks are due. It was impossible to carry out all suggestions
made, but none were passed over without consideration, and all
the changes made are in accord with what seemed to be the
general trend of opinion. lt would be difficult to overstate the
benefit received from the constant and painstaking assistance
given by the publishers and by the editors-in-chief of the series.
