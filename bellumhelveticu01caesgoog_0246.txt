The appendix, in its present form, is notan enlargement oi the former
one, but has been written independently. It is intended primarily to
gatherinto a systematic whole the grammatical notes given in the Iessons,
and to supplement them; and it is furthermore intended to include all
the grammatical material which need be put into the hands oi a Caesar
or Cicero class. The regular paradigma are given in full, with only such ·
exceptional forms as are needed fer the reading of Caesar and Cicero,
It is believed that the treatment of syntax covers all the essential usages
of those authore, and that the relatively large amount of explanation is
given only where it is needed. Rules are almost invariably stated in
full, so that when the student takes up a more complete grammar he
will have to master only the exceptions, not the principles.

The examples are in part made up, for the sake of brevity and clear-
ness, but are drawn largely from Caesar and Cicero¹ References to
Caesar are made by book, chapter, and line of the chapter as nearly
as the varying editions will permit. References to Cicero are made by
oration and scetiorr.

The writer has consulted the usual authorities and is under special
obligations, as regards the treatment of the verb, to the writings and
personal instruction of Professor William Gardner Halc. The present
treatment of the verbis by no means in full accord with Professor Hale’s,
yet it is largely influenced by it.
