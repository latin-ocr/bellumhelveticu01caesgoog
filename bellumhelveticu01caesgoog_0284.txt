88. Α sentence is a group oi words so related as to expressa thought.
It consiste ol at least two parta-the subject (that oi which something
is said), and the predicate (that which is said about the subject). These
two essential parts may be modified in various ways. A sentence may
consist ol a single verb, because the subject is implied in its ending.

presses one thought; ae caeam venit, theam cume.

90. A compound sentence consiste ol two or more simple sentences
connected in some way. Each sentence is called a clause.

as aad, but, sor, or, they are equally independent and are called coor-

dent (main) clause. Example: ubi caesar venit Galli fugerunt,
when Caesar conve the Gaulefled.
