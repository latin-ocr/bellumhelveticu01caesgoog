l or a alphaea. saal a syllable a sala a la long ay talare.

13. Α syllable is long if its vowel is followed by any two con-

* sonants except a mute followed by a liquid. The reason for

this will be clear if the student will compare the first syllables
in penny and pen-bleisa In perlny we pronounoe only one n and
the syllable is short. ln pentnife it takes time to pronounoe
the n at the end of the first syllable before the following conso-
nant. This makes the syllable long. So it always takes time to
pronounoe one consonant before another, except in the case of a
mute before a liquid. They run together so easily as to talle no
appreciable time. Compare the scunds of duc-tus and pla-tris
A syllable containing a short vowel followed by two consonante
is said to be long by position.

penult (next to the last syllable) if it is long (by nature or by
position); if the penult is short the accent falls orl the antepe-

nult (syllable before the penult). So dlvi‘sa, appellantur, but
in'eolunt.
