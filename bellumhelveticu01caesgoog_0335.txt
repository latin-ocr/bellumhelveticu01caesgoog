perfect active participle witha direct object can usually be translated
into Latin by putting the English object in the ablative and using the
passive participle in agreement with it (ablativo absolute, 150). *
⁰ Examples: visus fugit, haulay tceurccc he fleri· caesare viso fugit, har-inp
acea Cacsar lefled· literally, Cacsar hautay been seen lefled. See also 150.

a. But the perfect passive torm oi deponent verbs usually (not r
always) has an active meaning, so that with these verbs the change
described in 286 is not to be made. Example: caesarem conspicatus
frigit, lzau'uy secu Cacsar ltcflcd.

b. Besides the ordinary compound tenses of the passive, the
perfect participle is sometimes used with habeo. This emphasizes
the resulting fact rather than the past act. Example: magnis copias
coegit, hc collected preat saccea· magnas copias coactas habuit, same
translation, but implies he hod collected laryc forces aad still had thom. ’

’ c. Note the translation oi such phrases us post urbem conditam.
after thcfouudiup of the city· literally, after the city founded.

287. The gerund is an active verhal noun and corresponds to the
English verbal noun in -iup, except that it does not so commonly govern =
‚a direct object (see 289). It does regularly govern any other case that

(99, a), sor ihc sake offlectam ad persuadendum ei (115), jor permodico
lituu urbem videndi causa, sor the cuke of sectuy tlte city.

288. The gerundive is a passive adjective. In attributive (156)
agreement with a noun it lorms the so·called gerundive construction,
which is commonly used in place of the gerund with a direct object.
(For its other uses see 285, 11.) In this construction the English direct

¹ ¹ obiect takes the Latin case which the gerund would have, and the
gerundive agrees with it. There is no exact English equivalent; the

the gerund urbem videndi causa and the gerundive urbis videndae
causa (literally‚ sor theactc of llic city to br acea) both mean for the cuke ej
sectuy the city.
