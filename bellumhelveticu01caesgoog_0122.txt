use the same endings as that of the first, but add the vowel a to the pres-
ent stem instead of changing its final vowel (see 355). The present sub-
junctive of the third conjugation changes its final vowel to a. The imperfects
of all conjugations are formed just as that of the first is (see 355). itis
convenient to notice that the first person of the active imperfect may always
be found by adding m to the present infinitivo active.
