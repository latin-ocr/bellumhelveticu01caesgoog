express past time (compare the use of tenses in 221, t). Examples: si
fortis essct eum laudarem, is he were brace Ι should preire, or be pruisiny,
him (implying hut he ia not, aad Ι do not); nisi pro patria pugnavisset
eum non laudavissem, unless he had (is be had not) fought fer his country I
should not heve praised him (implying hut he did, and Ι d0; the contrary ci
the negative supposition); si pugnavisset cum laudarem, is he hed
fought, Ι should preire, or he proiciere, him (implying buthe did not, aad Ide
not; notice the change cf tense).

α. When the conclusion oi such conditions contains a verb meaning
could orouyhr, or such expressionsasilwould hehard, or just, the verb is
usually in the indicative, the imperfectior present time, the perfect or
pluperfect for past time. The condition requires the subjunctive, like
any other condition contrary tc fact. This is because the conclusion is
not usually really contrary to fact, though the English idiom makes it
seem sc. When the conclusion isreally contrary to laet, the subjunc-
tive is used. Examples: si fortis esset pugnare poterat, if he cerebrove
he could fieti (he has the power in auy case; hence the indicative); si
fortis fuisset pugnare debuit or debuerat, is he had been bave he ought
to lavesouqht (the duty rested upon him in any case; hence the indica·

256. More confident (virid) future. This is expressed in Latin by
the future or future perfect indicative in both clauses. The English may
mislead; for, though it uses the future in the conclusion, it commonly
uses the present with a future meaning in the condition. Is I see him Ι
shall tell him, means if Ichall see him Istud tell him, and the Latin is pre·
cise in using the future. Moreover, il the condition must be iulfilled
beforcxthe conclusion can take place, the Latin uses the future perfect,
while the English commonly uses the present, or, at most, the perfect.
Istc arrives first he will tell him, means iste shall tare uctred first, and the
Latin is precise in using the future perfect. Examplest si pegnabit
eum laudabo, if hefiyhtvor is fighting (stell fiyht or shall be fighting) Ι
shall prorae him,¹ qui pugnaverit laudabitur, whoever fiytts or has fought
(alrcll heve forneti) will te praised. ’
