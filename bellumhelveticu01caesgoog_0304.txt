THE VERB

AGREEMENT OF VERB ΑΝΟ SUBdECT

179. 11 there is but one subject, the finite verb agrees with it in
person and number, and in tbe compound tenses the participle agrees
with it in gender. Examples: caesar laudatus est, &marcomirem
mulieres laudatae sunt, the laomen aare praised.

a But the verb sometimes agrees with the meaning oi the subject
rather than its grammatieal lorm. Thus a singular collective noun
sometimes has a plural verb, and a neuter noun a masculine participle
in agreement. Examples: multitado venerunt, a preat number cama·
duo milia occisi sunt, two thousand were killed.

180. Ii there are two or more subjecte, the verb is usually plural,
· and in the compound tenses oi the passive the participle follows the
rule given ior predicate adjectivae (157, o, 2). ll the subjecta differ in
person the first person is prelerred to the second and the second to the
third. Examples: homost mulier occisi sunt, tlte man aad the woman
acm allea- ego et td venimus, you aad I came.

a. The verb may agree with the nearest subiect, especially ii the
verb stands first or aiter the first subject. It regularly does so ii the
subjecte are connected by conjunctione meaning or or nor. Examp'
