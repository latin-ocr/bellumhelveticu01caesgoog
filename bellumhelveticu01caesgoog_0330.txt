270. The tenses of the subjunctive have the same meanings and
follow the same rule in indireet discourse as elsewhere (aco-204). The
quotation depende on the verb of scytes or thinking and is in primary
sequence if that verb is primary, secondary if it is secondary.

a. But aiter a past verb of semoy or thinking the quoter very often
drops the secondary sequence and uses the tenses of the original speaker,
for the sake of vividness. Example: respondit: . . . cum sa itasint
.. . sese pacem esse facturum (Caes. I, 14, 17), ke replied. . . thal
although these things are so berall make peace. “

b. After a perfect infinitivo the secondary sequence must be used

even if the infinitive depende on a primary verb of saying or thinking;
for the perfect infinitive is past, even though it depends on a present.
Example: dicit Gaesamm laudatum essequod fortis esset, hesepe
that Caesar was praised because he was broce. (Notice that the English is

ecce, not is.)

c. In changing from the direct form to a subjunctive of the indirect
the following rule is helpful; keep the stem of the original and follow
the sequence. So for example a present or future indicative becomes
present subjunctive after dicit, imperfect after dixit, in either case re·
taining the present stem; a perfect or future perfect indicative becomes
perfect subjunctive after dicit, pluperfect after dixit, in either case re·
taining the perfect stem:

271. If a pronoun of the first person changes to one of the third
person it must be to some form of sui or suus (rarely of ipse). All other
changes of person or pronouns are the same as in English. Example:
hunc militem laudo, Ι preire this soldier, may become dico me hunc
militem laudere, I say thot Iproiee thir soldier, or dicit se illum militem
laudere, be says that he proicer thot soldier. Adverbs will be changed in
che same way, now to then, bere to there, etc. Vocatives will become

nominatives or disappear.

272. Ι. The condition, since it is the dependent clause, must have
its verb in the subjunctive. The tense follows the rule of sequence
except that the imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive of conditione con-
trcry to fact never change, even after a primary tense.

Π. The conclusion, since it is the principal clause, must have its
