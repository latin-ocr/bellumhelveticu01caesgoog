54. lt has already been shown that Latin changes the forms ci nouns to
indicate which is subject and which is object, and that these forms are called
cases. There ere, in all, six cases, each oi which shows a different relation
to other words in a sentence. Most oi these relations can be expressed in
English only hythe use oi such prepositions as os, to, from, ty, etc. Exam-
ples: linguae partes, the parts of c longucge ,· lingua differunt, they differ
in loaguuge.

55. Iaflectioa is the process oi changing the form oi a word to show its
relation to other words in e sentence.

56. Declamion is the special neme given to the inflection oi nouns, ad- ἶ
jectives, and pronouns. “

57. Latin nouns are inflected in five deciensions, distinguished from one
another by the final letter (characteristic) of their stems, and hythe termi-
nation oi the genitive singular. In the vocabularies the termination oi the ’
genitive singular is given aiter the nominative, and the deciension thus
readily and certainly made known. In those nouns which have only plural
forms, the ending oi the genitive plural is placed after the nominative form.

58. In the first deciension the stem vowel, cr characteristic, is Μ the
genitive singular ends in -ae From the characteristic vowel ι, this is some-
times called the h deciensicn. ’

In learning the paradigm oi lingua, observe the base, to which the end·
inge are affixed, and the meaning of each case. The base is that part oi the
word to which the genitive singular ending is added.
