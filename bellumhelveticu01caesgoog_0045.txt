GENDER

lO'I. English nouus have only natural gender. Names oi males are mas-
culine; oi iemales, feminine3 01 things without life, neuter. But in Latin,
as in 11011011 and German, there is a grammatica gender. Here too names
oi males are masculine and names oi iemales feminine ; but other nouns are
masculine, feminine, or neuter, with no apparent reason 101 the choica.
Thus ager, field, is masculine; terra, land, feminine, solum, soil, neuter.
Itis absolutely necessary to know the gender oi every noun. The nomina-
tive iorm will tell the gender oi very many nouns; a few general rules,
given in App. 1³, will help about some others; but ior the rest memory
must be depended upon.

108. The chiei reason why the gender 01 each noun must be known is
that Latin adjectives are declined and have special forms to show the gender
