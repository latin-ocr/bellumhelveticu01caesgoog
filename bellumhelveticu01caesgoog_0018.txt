ment they met at the southern point of Lake Genava. There
they assembled in the spring of 58 ac, to the number of three
hundred and sixtycight thousand, of whom ninety-two thousand
were men-atarms. Under modern civilization the same country
now supports a population of two millions eight hundred and
fifty thousand.

At Lake Geneva the Helvetii found their advance opposed by
Caesar. Their most natural course wasto cross the Rhone, pass-
ing through a corner of the Roman province in southeastern '
Gaul. They sent a deputation asking permission to pass through
the province without damage. To gain time, Caesar put them
off to a second contarenus, spent the interval in construetinga
line of fortifications along the Rhone, and then formally forbade
their passage.
¹ After vainly endeavoring to force a passage of the Rhone, the
Helvetii, by arrangement with the Sequani, their neighbors on
the northwest, proceeded to cross the Saone instead of the Rhone
and thence to march westward. Caesar added five fresh legions
to the oue already at his disposal, and after about three-fourths
of the Helvetian troops had crossed the Saone, fell upon and eut
to pisces the remainder. Efforts on the partos the Helvetii to
procure terms oi peace satisfactory to themselves proved unavail-
ing, and after some minor contests the final decisive battle was
fought at the Aeduan town, Bibracte, now Autun. Caesar ao ‚
“ knowledges that the battle was closely contested and for along
time doubtful, but in the end Roman arms and discipline won
a victory that ended all the hopes of the Helvetii. At the com-
mand of Caesar they returned to their desolated homes, but with
the loss of more than twothirds of their entire number. Remains
of skeletons, ornaments, and arms have been unearthed on the
field of the great battle near Autun
