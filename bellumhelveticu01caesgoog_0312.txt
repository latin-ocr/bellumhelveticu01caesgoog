205. Infinitives and participles can not be used as independent verbs
(but sce 281). They take their time from the verb on which they depend,
and express only the stage of progress oi the act (see iss), and therefore
do not need forms enough to express 311 the tenses. That is, a present
infinitiveor participle expresses action as going on at the time of the
main verb, whether thet is present, future, or past3 aiuture expresses
action as iuture 13 the time oi the main verb; and 3 perfect expresses
action as completed at the time oi the main verb. The following table
gives examples oi the infinitivo. The tense meanings oi the participles
are the same. ’

a. With such periects as debui, licuit, oportuit, potui, Latin must
use the present infinitiva, though English says cupid to hace, etc.
Exempla: laudisne potui, I could hore praised.

b. Some verbs lack the supine stem and therefore have no future
active infinitive. The future passive infinitiva which is given in the
paradigma is rarely used. In both cases the place of the future
infinitivo is taken by fore (sutrinam esse) ut, it would he that, with the
present or imperfect subjunctive. Examples: dicit fore ut timeat, he
