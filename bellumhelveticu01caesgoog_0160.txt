519. consulem: see 160. Helvetiis: see 320. animo: see 468.
facultate: see 344.

520. Memoria tenere, to remember, is equivalent in meaning to averb
of thinking, and is followed by the accusative and infinitivo.

521. Esse is very often omitted in the future active and perfect passive
infinitives Here it is to be supplied with occisum, pulsum, missum,
and temperaturos.

slain in battle by the Tigurini, a part oi the Helvetii.

523. sub iugum missum: two spears were set upright in the ground
and a third fastened across their tops. A defeated army was made to march
under this in token oi submission.

524. Sub governs its cases on the same principle asin. See App. 154.

525. concedendum: supply esse. The gerundive with some form
of the verb sum, expressed or understood, is used in Latin to express neces-
sity or obligation. This is generally rendered by the use of the auxiliarios
mast or cupiit. Thus concedendum min putabat, he did aot thiale it was
to be pranted or oupht to be granted. This forms what is called the second,
or passive, periphrastic conjugation. Compare 414.

526. faciundi: another forrn of the gerundivo. See 409.

527. Notice that the imperfect is used in the principat verbs here (see
349), because these sentences describo tho condition of things under which
Caesar gave the reply in the next sentence.
