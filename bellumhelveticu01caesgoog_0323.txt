c. Inserted clauses. These are found in sentences which containan
event and asituation and which are more naturally expressed as in 242, a.
Sometimes that natural order of expression is inverted, so that the
situation is expressed in the principal clause (by an imperfect or plu·
perfect indicative), and tho event in the cum clausa (by a perfect or
historica] present indicative). Example: summus mons 5. Labieno
tenebatur, cum censimus accurrit (compare 242, a, example), the top
os the nrounlain was in tho possession os Labienus, when ap rodo Considius.

242. Subjunctive clauses. The subjunctive is used with temporal
cum in the following clauses:

o. Stoation and narrative clauses. A situation clause describes the
situation (condition of things, accompanying circumstances) under which
an event took place, the event being told in the prinoipal clause. It

corresponds, in some degree, to a characterizing relative clause (230).
Such a clause almost invariably tells a new point in the narrative, and =

may therefore be called a narrative clause. situation and narrative

clauses are thus the same thing, but sometimes the one or the other i
name seems more applicable. In writing Latin, if it seems doubtful ¹
whether a clause belongs here or under 241, a, it almost certainly be· J
longs here. (The causal and adversative clauses [239] grow out of this 2
clause, because almost e'very clause which describes the situation gives ,

a reason for [causal] oragainst [adversative] the main event.) Example:

cum summus mons a Labieno teneretur, neque adventus cognitus

b. Generalizinp clarnos. The generalizing clause (241, b) is sometimes
inthe subjunctive. Example: cum ferrum st inflexisset, neque evel-
lere . . . . poterant (Caes. 1, 25, 8), when tte iron point had tent (in each

causat clauses

243. Dependent causal clauses are introduced by the conjunctione
eum, quod, quia, quoniam, and quando, or by the relative. The con·
junctione nam, enim, etenim, sor, introduce coordinate clauses.

244. Quod, quia, quoniam, and quando, become, sincaere regularly
'used with the indicative. But clauses with quod, quia, and quoniam
often give a reason, not on the authority of the writer, buton that of the
