by the order oi words or by the use of prepositions; yet the soealled
possessive case illustratas the use oi the Latin cases, ior the ending 'r
in the soldier’samis indicates that soldier modifies arras and that the
soldier is the possessor oi the arms. But in the English sentences tlte
soldier (subJect) flplils, lie leills ilie soldier (direct object), lie pices ilie soldier
(indirect object) a suord, only the order of words shows the relation oi
the word to the rest oi the sentence; while in Latin miles wouldbe

used in the first sentence, militem in the second, and militi in the ³

third.

93. But each of the cases (except the vocative) expresses more than
one thing. Consequently one must know just what useseach casecan have,
and mustthen determine which one oi these uses it has in the sentencein
which it occurs. This can bc determined sometimes by the meaning ol
the word itseli, sometimes by the obvious meaning of the sentence,
sometimes by the fact that another word needs a certain case to satisfy
its meaning and that case appears but once in the sentence. Examples:
the accusative may express duration oi time, but militem, asold-ia,
could not be used in this sense, while multis annea, marry years, is quite
probably so used. Dicit pilum militem vulneravisae might mean
either lie says that a jarelirr woaaded ilie soldier, or a soldier waaaded ille
jocelin, but the latter makes no sense. Perauisit, lre persuaded, needs

a dative to express the person persuaded, and ii there is but one dative

in the sentence its use is evident.

94. For further cleamess many relations are expressed in Latin by
prepositions, though not so many as in English. Examples: 5, milite
interiectus est, lie raas lrilled by a soldier,· cum milite venit, lie came in
company arilli a soldier.
