Fiftt .· The text is treated a fourth time in questions in Latin
to be answered in Latin by the student. These questions pro
mote that mastery of the language which is to be attained only
by its use in this way. They are suggestive, and the toacher
can vary them and increase their number at pleasure.

Stroth: Paradigms of deelensions and conjugations and the
principles of syntax are introduced gradually, after the student
has acquired words and sentences illustrating these forms and
principles. The book is complete without a grammar. Each
principle is explained but 01100, and when illustratione of the
same fact appear reference is made by figures to the first
example and explanation. The explanations of the text and of
many grammatical principles are given in notes in connection
with each lesson. These notes are to be carefully learned and
recited, to insure thoroughness and prevent waste 01 time in
frequently referring to the same subject.

In the revised form many Latin-English exercises have been -
inserted. The amount of text in each lesson is necessarily very
small at first, and not sufficient to give a proper drill in trans·
lating Latin. On the other hand the English-Latin exercises
have been shortened, simplified, 01 rewritten. Some of the new
exercises are merely for drill on forms or points 01 syntax.
Some are intended· for oral work, some for written, though 110
separate headings are given to indicate their purpose.

An especial effort has been made to simplify the early lessons
and to lead the student on by steps 01 very gradually increasing
difficulty. With this object in view the early lessons have been
shortened and the paradigms have been presented much more
gradually, in 0 changed order, and spread out over more lessons.

Many review lessons have been given, perhaps more than
some teachers need. If this should be the case two can be com-
bined very easily; or some may even be omitted, since no new
principles are given in them. But the reviser would prefer still
more rather than less.

The Latin questions in the original book included questions
