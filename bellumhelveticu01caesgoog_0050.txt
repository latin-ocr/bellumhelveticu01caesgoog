· 124. Nouus ol the third declension have -s or no case-ending in the nomi-
native singular. The genitive oi nouus oi the third deolension always ends iu
-is. Masculine, feminine, and neuter nouus are declined alike except that
in neuters the accusative is like the nominative, and that their nominative,
accusative, and vocative plural end in -ε,

125. In learning a new noun, the nominative and genitive singular and
the gender should always be tixed in the memory. This is especially neees-
sary in the third deelension lor three reasons hirst, as has been said, there
may be a nominative ending -s or none. Second, the stem oi the nomina-
tive and vocative singular may differ from that oi the genitive and the other
casea, as in sshmen, fluminis, river. Third, the gender ean not always be
told from the nominativo ending, as it usually can in the other deciensions.

126. The stems oi third deolension nouns end in a consonant or in l.
The-i oi the stem makes some slight changes in the endings ; and therefore
l-stems will be given in another Iesson. After learning the two following
nouus the student should be ableto decline any noun with consonant stem,
if he knows the nominative, the genitive, aud the gender.
