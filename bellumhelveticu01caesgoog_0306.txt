expresses will. Example: lauda, proim (thou).

OTHER νΕΗΒΑΙ. foetus

186. rho Infinitive is not, strictly speaking, a mode, but a verbal
noun. Itis, however, used as a mode in certain kinds oi dependent
clauses. Example: dicit Gaesarem laudari, he ruys thar Caeam is praised.

187. Verbal Noune and Adjectives. The gerund and the supine
are verbal nouns3 the gerundive and the participles are verbal adjectivae.
None oi these can form clauses in Latin, though they are olten best
translated by clauses in English.

ΤΗΕ ΝΕΘΑΤΙνΕὸ
188. There are two kinds ol negatives in Latin.

a. Non, not, and neque, and not, nor, are used everywhere except in
expressions ol will or wish; that is, they are used with the indicative,
the subjunctive oi contingent futurity, the subjunctive of fact, and the
infinitive. Examples: nim laudat, hedonnotpraiaa ndu laudet, he ⁴
would not pratae.

h. Nestor, and neve, and not, nor, are used with all the model
meanings which express will or wish; that is, with the subjunctive oi
desire and (in poetry only) the imperative. Examples: ne laudet, let
him aotproise, or moy he notpraise. Ne quidem, notavere, is used in
statements.

THE TENSES

189. The tense oi a verb tells either one or both oi two things: (l)
the time oi the action, whether past, present, or future; and (2) the
stage ol progress oi the action at that time, whether already completed,
still going on, or about to take place. For example, the following forms
are all past, and yet express different things ; laudavit, hc praised, simply
puts the action in the past; laudaverat, he laod praised, means that the
aetion was already completed in the past time ; laudabar, hewoapraisiap,
means that the action was going on in the past time; and laudatarus
erat, he was poinq to proice, means that in the past time the action was
on the point of taking place. Latin is much more accurate in its use
oi tenses than English is, and it is important to understand araon·-
what each of its tenses means.
