uses the present indicative est balneans that something lc at the time es
speakiaffi the perfect fuit means that something is already cccr at the
time es speratam the future erit means that something will be after the
time cs speaking. But the present infinitiva means present at the linteos
its principat vcrb; the perfect infinitive means past in reference t0 the
tinec of its principat ccrb; and the future infinitiva means future to the
tintcof lfa principat verb. For example, the present infinitiva of laudt't is
laudare. Laudare then means that the act cf praising belongs tc tlrc
same timeas the act of its principa] verb. Notice how it must be translated:

ᾱῑοὸ seminudam, I say binc fo be prefatae, means I cap that be is prclslnp
now ;

diensem} laudare, Ι shall say him fo be prantnp, means 1 caedecatitae
he is preislap lat the future time when Ι say it) ;

dixi eum laudare, 1 said him to bc praeta, means 1 said that he was
praesiny (at the past time when Ι said it).

In a similar way the future infinitiva laudamine esse is future to the
verb on which it depende.

ᾱῑοό eum laudatarum csse, 1 say lbet he will praiae;
dicam eum laudatarum esse, l stell say that he will praba
dixi eum laudatarum esse. Ι eald that lte wenhf pratae.

And the perfect infinitiva laudavisse is past tc the verb cn which it
depends.

ᾱῑοό eum laudavisse. Ι say that he praiscd5
dicam eum laudavisse] challane increpassem
dixi eum laudavisse, I said lbet he had praised.

510. The future active infinitive is made up cf the future active parti-
ciple and esse; and the perfect passive Infinitive is made up of the perfect
passive participle and esse. 'l'hese participles agree in gender, number,
and case, with the subject ei tlte infinitive. Examplcs: dics) eum lauda-
tritum esse, Ι repetatne will praisc‚· ᾶῑοό eam laudhtfiram esse, I say
that alte will praise; ᾱῑοό ecs laudatr'rrt'rs esse, I say fleat nep will praee.
