294. biennium sibi satis esse duxerunt: dixerunt has here its
less usual meaning oi thought. A verb meaning to ihmh has been used
before, followed by the infinitiva (see 2³4 and 241). Biennium is the
accusative, subject oi esse. Setinis aprcdicate adjective. The literal
meaning is ihoupht iwo years to be enough for themselves. Translate, thought
that two years were enooph sor them.

295. in tertium annum: translate, for the third gear.

296. confirment: notice that although this is a present tense it is
used oi past time. This is called the historicai present. In English a
present is sometimes used in the same way, but not nearly as often as in
Latin. It is, therefore, better to translate by a past tense.

A reflexive pronoun is one which reiers to the subjectas himself in he
promes himself. ln the third person Latin has a special pronoun for this
purpose. As this pronoun can neither be the subject oi a finite verb nor
agree with such a subject, it can never he a nominative or a vocative, so
these cases are lacking. (H imself in he himself praises him is quite another
vvord in Latin, ior it only emphasizes he ,· it vvonld he nominative.) As the
reflexive pronoun refers to the subiect one can always he sure oi its number
aod gender, so that the same forms are used ior both numbers and all gen:
ders. Examplcs: homo se iaudat, the moa praises himsels; mulier se
iaudat, the woman praises herself ; Galli se laudant, the Gaulo pratae
hemseioea
