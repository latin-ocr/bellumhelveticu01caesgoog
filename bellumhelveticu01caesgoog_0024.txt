BELLUM HELVETIOUM

LESSON l

l'I. ΤΕΧΤ

The most important part of the recitation period is that spent by the
teaoher in preparing the class ior studying the next day's lesson. Pronun-
ciation in particular must be learned almost wholly irom the toacher, though
the pupil should be referred constantly to the Introductory Lesson. Unless
the correct pronunciation oi each word is firmly fixed in the student's mind
beiore he is allowed to study the loeson by himself, he will surely acquire
incorrect habits oi pronunciation. A correct pronunciation is easily acquired
at the beginning. A lew weeks ol carelessness will fix incorrect habits
almost incurably.

Although the words below are divided into syllables it must be under-
stood that they are to be pronounced smoothly as in English, with no breaks
between the syllables.

just as -est in digram the syllable is long (13), but this does not make the
vowel long (compare 3 and 13). 0m¹·nis: om·‚ neither as in home nor as
in omnibus3 ο as the German short o, nearly as eiusce, not exactly like any .
English vowel; i as in pic. divi-sa: dee-wedam s as in said· a as in
