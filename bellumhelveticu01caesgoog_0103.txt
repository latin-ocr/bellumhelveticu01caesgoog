ΤΗΕ ΡΑ88ΝΕ VOiCE

313. In the active voice the subject is represented as acting. Exempla:
iilius laudat, tlte soa praises. In the passive voice the subjectis repre-
sented as acted on. Exempla ε filius laudatur, ihc soa is praised.

314. In the passive voice the tenses formed on the present stem (264),
bave the following persona] endings :

sisennas ’ raanan
·or, -r (Ι) ·mur (we)
·ris, -re (thou, you) -mini (you)
-tur (he, she, it) -ntur (they)

315. By employing these terminatione instead of the active forms (263),
the present, imperfect, and future tenses in the passive are formed exactly as
the corresponding tenses in the active are (264), except that the vowel
changes before the passive endings are not always the same as before the
active endings.

. 316. The perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect passive are made up

of the perfect passive participle and the present, imperfect, and future of
sum. This perfect passive participle can always be formed by changing
to s the final m in the supine (the last of the four principal parts). Exam-
ple: supine, laudatum perfect participle, laudatus. Laudatus means
haciap been praised. Laudatus sum, therefore, meansI am bariap been
praised, i.e., I iace been praised, 1 was praised; laudatus eram, 1 aas
baasa been praised, i.e., I bad been praised ,· etc. The participle is declined
like an adjective of the first and second declensions, and must, of course,
agree with the subject. Examples: filius laudatus eat, ibe son was
praised; filii laudati sunt, tie soris were praiscd; legatio laudata est,
the embassy was praised.

317. The principal parts in the passive are the first person singular ᾖ
present indicative, the present infinitivo, the first person singular perfect in-
dicative. But these parts need not be learned when the verb has active
forms.
