DEPENDENT CLAUSES

223. Dependent clauses are those which are attached to other clauses
by a relative or interrogative pronoun or adverb, or by a subordinating
conjunction. subordinating conjunctions are such as mean is, because,
allbwph, when, aster, before, ia order that, so that, and the like.

Neither the relatives nor any oi the conjunctions have in themselves
any eiiect on the mode of the verb in the dependent clause; but that
clause may contain the indicative or the subjunctive with any oi its
meanings (184, c-c). Dependent clauses are classified according to their
meaning and use in the following groups: purpose clauses (225), result
clauses (226), substantive clauses oi desire (228), substantive clauses ol
result or fact (229), characterizing relative clauses (230), determining
relative clauses (231), parenthetical relative clauses (232), temporal
clauses (233-242), causal clauses (243-245), adversative clauses (246,
247), substantive quod clauses (248), conditional clauses (249-259),
clauses oi proviso (260), clauses of comparison (261), indirect questions
(262-264), indirect discourse (266-273), attracted clauses (274), in-
finitiva clauses (277-280).

224. A clause which gives the purpose oi an act is usually quite dis-
tinct in meaning from one which states its result; yet in Latin torm
they are often identical, and sometimes difficult to distinguish. The
subjunctive oi desire (184, α) is used in purpose clauses, the subjunctive
oi fact (164, c) in result clauses. This explains the dilierence in nega·
tives (188), and on the other hand the presence oi anegative determines
the kind ol clause. In the ut clauses, or when an English clause is to be·
translated into Latin, the only test is the meaning; if any ieeling oi will
or intention is implied, the clause is one oi purpose; otherwise, oi result.

PURPOSE CLAUSES

226. The commonest expression oi purpose in Latin is a subjunctive
clause. The infinitive, common in English, is never to be used For
the so-called substantive clause of purpose, see 228. The connecting
words are as lollows:
