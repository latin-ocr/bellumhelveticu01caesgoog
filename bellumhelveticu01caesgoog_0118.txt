355. The subjunctive has only four tenses—present, imperfect, per·
lect, and pluperlect. Of these the present and imperfect are formed on the
present stem. The present subjunctive 11 formed by changing the final
vowel of the present stem, or by adding 510 the present stem, and adding
the personal endings (263 and 314) ; as lauda„ laude, present subjunc-
tive, laudem. The imperfect subjunctive is formed by adding re to the
unchanged present stem, and to this the personal endings ; as, laudi· -1-16,
imperfect subjunctive, laudarem.

356. The meanings of the subjunctive mode meist be learned in connec-
tion with the constructione in which it is used. No satisfactory mennings
can be given with the paradigms.1

¹ Although it lshoped that the explanation of the uses of the subjunctive given in
the appendix may be found helpful. it has not seemed best 1ο give thern at this point
as a necessary part of thelasson. Itis recommended that App. 182-184 be studied

in connection with this lesson. Otherwise the toacher must give such explanation of
the menningo as he thinks p'roper.
