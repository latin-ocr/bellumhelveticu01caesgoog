Review what was said of the imperfect aud perfect in 226. Now read
ever Chapter III. and notice the indicative tenses, ior they are typical of
Caesar's general usage. Notice that in every sentence the principal verb
tells a new point in the story and is a perfect or the equivalent historical
present. The dependent clauses do not tell new points in the story, but
either tell oi something that had happened before the time of the principal
verb (pluperfect tense) ordescribe something as going on or existing at the
time of the principal verb (imperfect tense). They determinet -theyde-
cadet-they set tlte dcte-'Oryetorir was chonen—lie accepted—he per-
suaded: all these are perfecte or presents. But now in a subordinate clause
it is learned that before this time some one had held-hadheen called (plu-
perfects). Again in the historical present Orgetorix persuaded, and in a sub
ordinate clame it is learned that at that time some one wne in power - was
deur (imperfecta).

No fixed rule ean be given. The tenses are always used to express the
shade of meaning wanted. But this is a good principle to work on: in
dealing with past time, unless the meaning clearly calls for some other tense
