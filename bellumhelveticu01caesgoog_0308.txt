11. The historica] (or indefinite) perfect simply puts the action in
the past. without telling anything about the stage of progress (189) at ’
that time. It corresponds to the English past tense. Example: laudavi,
I praised.-

the past, or puts it ata time before another past point of time. See
189. Example: laudaveram, I hod praised.

197. In telling of past events the indicative tenses used are the his·
torical perfect (or the equivalent historical present), the imperfect, the
pluperfect, and occasionally the imperfect periphrastic. The perfect is
the narrating tense in which the successive main events of the story are
told. The other tenses are the descriptive tenses in which the details
which surround the main events are told. See 189.

For example, suppose one wished to begin a story with the following
points. “The Helvetians lived in a small country; they planned to
leave; Caesar went to Ganl.'' 'sold in that way all the verbs would be
perfects; bnt the story is badly told. One would certainly pick out
some chief event or events and group the others about them; and what-
ever evcnts he so picked ont would be expressed by the perfect, while
the rest would be imperfect and pluperfect. He might begin in this
way, “The Helvetians, who lived .......... planned ......... But Caesar
went .......... ” Then plaaneti and went are perfecte, each being thr
of as a separate step in the story ς bnt lived is thought of as a subor
