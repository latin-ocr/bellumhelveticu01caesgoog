190. rho Present regularly puts the action in the present time and
corresponds to all the forms of the English present. Example: laudat,
lie pruina lie ia prcinnp, he does maiae.

u. The historical present speaks of a past fact as if it were present,

· in order to put it vividly before the mind. It ismuch more common in

Latin than in English, and, therefore, should usually be translated bya

past. Example: oppida sua omnia incendunt (Caes. I, o, 4), they
buracd (burn) ull their towns.

b. With such expressions as iam disi, iam pridem, sor a lorap ome,

’ multos annoajor mcaypeora, the Latin present is to be translated by

the English perfect. Example: multos annos to moneo, I have been

lcurniup you for many years. There are really two ideae, “I have been in

the past’ and “I still am.'’ English expresses one of them; Latin, like
Erench and German, expresses the other.

c. For the present with dum, etc, see 234, a.

Ι 9 Ι. The Imperfect puts the action in the past and represents itas
going on at that time. See ¹⁸9: Exempla: laudabat, he was praiaiap.

a. The imperfect is often used of repeated past action, as landobet,
lwused to pratae, or lie kept praiaco. Itis less osten used oi attempted
past acti0n3 as laudabat, he tried to maian

b. With the expressions mentioned in 190, b, the imperfect is to be
translated by the English past perfect. Example: multoe annos to
· monobam, I llud been wurcing] pou for many years.

192. The Futuro puts the action in the fut⁰ure time and corresponds
to the English future. See 199. Example: laudabo, Iehall or aiil

praua, or be praiaiap.
193. The Perfect has two uses.

Ι. The present (or definite) perfect corresponds to the English per-
fect with hove. It represents the action as completed at the present
time. Example: laudavi, I have praised.

a. This perfect is often nearly equivalent toa present. For example,
voni, I hace come, is nearly equivalent to 1 am here. A few perfecte are y
regularly translated by presente especially novi, cognovi, I know y
(literally I have found out), and consuevi, I am cemulomed (literallyl l
tave become acmulomed).
