you qoinyt’h or it may be quoted indirectly ;that is, with such changes as
make it adependent clause, as he celred where I (or he) wera yor'ny. In the
latter iorm it is an indirect question. The mode in allindirect questions
is the subjunctive.

26³. All the subjunctive questions oi 209 and 210 retain the same
modal meanings in the indirect iorm. Exampies: rogo quis veniat,
I usk who would corne rogo quid taciem, I art wirot I um to do; rogeri
quid facerem, 1 osted what Ι war to do.

264. All indicative questions change to the subjunctive oi fact (184,
c), which must be translated by an indicative.

a. When the direct question is introduced by an interrogative pro· ¹

noun, adjective, or adverb (212), the same word serves to introduce the
indirect iorm. Examples: roge quis venerit, I aeh who come mihi
dixit ubi esset, he told me where he urar.

b. When the direct question can be answered by yes orno (213) the
indirect form is introduced by num or -ne, whether (no diiierence in
meaning). Si is alo used in the sense of to aee whether or whether. Examples:
rogo num veniat, I art whether he r'e coming· rogr'avi venissetne, Ι osted .
whether he had corna· exspectavit si venirent, he wuited to aee whether they
would corne.

e. Indirect double questions are introduced by the same partiales as

he hertfowyht or etot.

265. Direct dhcowrre repeats the exact words oi a remark or a
thought. Example: herrad, “theroictiersarehrore.” Indireet discowrre
repeats a remark or thought with such changes in the words as to make
oi it a dependent construction. Example: he aoid thot the solrh'era
were brace. Indirect discourse may quote a long speech consisting oi
separate sentences and periods may be used between these sentences;
but, none the less, ¹each sentence is to be thought oi a· depending on a
verb oi aayr'ny or thinking which may be either expressed or impiied at
the beginning. When one speaks oi a principat clause in indirect dis·
