diiierence. Example: venit qud facilius videret, he cante that he ncipit

eea· venit ut videat, he comes to ιιι.

hoc iecit ne quis videret (not ut nemo). he ew this that no one mictrt sec,

or to keep annone from scctnp.
RESULT CLAUSES

226. Result is expressed in Latin by the subjunctive with ut (affir-
mative) erut non (negative). The subjunctive is sometimes one oi con-

tingent futurity (184, b), tobetranslated hyrcanici, etc, or, more ireely, ιο
’ αι to (tendency rather than result); but usually it is the subjunctive oi
lact (184, c), to be translated by the indicative. Notioe that the imper-
fect subjunctive in this construction must usually be translated by the
perfect indicative. But see 204, ο, at end. For the socalled relative
clause ‘oi result see 230. For the substantive clause oi result see 229.
“ Examples: mons impendebat, ut perpauci prohibere possent (Caes.
I, 6, 5), amountat'n overhany, ιο that sowy few could easily ebech· incredibili
lenitate, ita ut iudicari non possit (Caes. Ι, 12. 3), os extracrdiacry

227. These clauses diiier from clauses of purpose and result in that
they are used like noune, either as the object oi a transitive verb, or as
the subject oi the passive, cr in apposition with a noun or neuter pronoun.

There is the same difference between the two substantive clauses as ι

between clauses oi purpose and those oi result, and they are to be ι
distinguished in the same way (224). ¹

228. Although these clauses are usually called substantive clauses oi .
purpose, they do not really express purpose but are expressions oi will
or wish used as objects, etc, oi verbs. For example: impero ut eds, 3

but rather I pice the command, “9⁰’'· Thispo wouldbeexpressedby the
imperative in an independent sentence (185) but must be the subjunctive

upon the meaning oi the principal verb.
