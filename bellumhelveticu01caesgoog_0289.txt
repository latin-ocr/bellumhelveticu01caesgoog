112. The dative expresses that to or ior which anything is or is
done. It may depend on a verb or an adjective or, very rarely, a noun;
or may modiiy a whole sentence without depending on any one word.

113. Indirect object. The indirect object is a dative used to
denote the person or thing indirectly affected by the action oi a verb.
It most commonly gives the personto whom something is done. Because
oidiiierences between English and Latin idiom no one translation can

be given lor it.

Ι 14. Indirect object with [transitive Verba. Many verbs which
govern an accusative oi the direct object take also a dative oi the indireet
object, usually translated by to, less often by for. (For the indirect
object with transitive verbs compounded with a preposition see 116).
Exempla: si filiam dat (Caes. I, 8, 17), tc picea (to) him his daughter.

a. Doni), pice, praeerat, and a few other verbs take either the dative oi
the person and the accusative oi the thing, or the accusative oi the person
and the ablativa oi the thing. Examples: ei librum ddnd, I yive (tc) him
a boch· eum librd ddnd, I present him arith a book.

b. Some verbs, instead oi admitting both the accusative and the
dative, admit either, but with a different meaning. Especiallchonsulr'r,
canali or conscit sor, and metui), sear or sear scr. Examples: si ma
cdnsulistcic.0at.1, 13), if poa consult me (calc my adaloch cdnsulite
vdbisleic. Cat. IV, 3), consult sor youraelvea (jor your own interam).

c. This dative is retained with the passive voice. Example: ei filia
datur, ta daughter ia given lo him.

115. The Indirect Object With Intransitive Verba. The dative
is used with many intransitive verbs, most oi which seem to be trans-
itive in English. It must often be translated hythe English direct
object. (For the indirect object with intransitive verbs compounded
with a preposition see 116.)

The dative (usually oi the person) is thus used with most verbs
meaning beneyt or injure, command or obey, plenae or dtapleaae, serve or

restat, tant or diatreta, 'believe cocy, favor, pardos, peramato, apere, threaten, l

and the like. Examples: novis rebus studebat (Caes. 1, 9, 8), he was
canoas sor c revolutos,- Allobrogibus imperavit (Caes. I, 28, 8), lte Ἰ
commanded tlte Allobroga,- civitati persuasit (Caes. Ι, 2, 4), he permaded

the atate. ἶ
