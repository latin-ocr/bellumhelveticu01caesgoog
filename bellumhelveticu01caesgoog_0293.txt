125. A. Two Objecte. A few verbs take two objecta, one oi the
person, one ol the thing.

a. Verbs oi asking or demanding, and celo, I camel, have a direct
object of the thing, and may have another of the person. Example:
Aeduos frumentum flagitiare (Caes. Ι, 16,1), bc kept athap tlte Aedui sor
the proin But with verbs of asking and demanding the person is usually j
expressed by the ablative with ab or ex.

b. Moneo, I worn, adase, and a few other verbs may take an ac-
cusative oi the person and the neuter accusative oi a pronoun or adjec-
tive oi the thing. Example: eos hoc moneo (Cic. (lat. 11‚20)‚Ip·ve
them thia conce.

c. With the passive of these verbs the accusative oi the person be-
comes the subject, and the accusative oi the thing is retained. Example:
Aedui frumentum flagitabantur, tho Aedui rcere asloed sor the pretim (ei)
hbc monentur, they ore picen lbra oderice.

appointed king· caesarem certiorem fecit, bc infornwd Cbeaar (macla

Cacsar more cencio).

a. With the passive oi these verbs the direct object becomes the
subject, and the predicate accusative becomes the predicate nominative
