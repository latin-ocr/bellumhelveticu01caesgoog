and infinitiva is the regular construction aiter verbs oi scytha or talliam,
just as it is after verbs of thinking.

496. ab urbe: place from which. In 419 no preposition was used.
See App. 134, a. Το a Roman “the city’' was Rome. Caesar had been
consul the preceding year and was now making preparations to go ιο his
province. The repert oi the Helvetians' pians hastened his movements.

497. quam maximis potest itineribus: compare 2⁷6. There no =

to go outside oi his province and do things never thought of by the Romans
when they sent him there. ¹
