lMPERFEGT TENSE

226. 11 has been seen that the perfect expresses simply a past act or
state. The imperfect is also a past tense. but besides telling that the act
or state was past, it also tells that it was still poley oa at the past time. For
example: laudavit means lte probem it simply tells a past 1001 : laudabat
means he was pedatiam it tells that the aet is past, and also that it was still
going on at the past time one is thinking about. Sometimes laudabat
must be translated hy he praised, because English is not as precise in theuso
01 1011000 00 Latin is.

227. The first conjugation forms the imperfect indicative active by add-
ing -ba- to the present stem, 00 0 tense-sign, and using 1110 001110 endings as
in the present, except that 1110 first person ends in -m.
