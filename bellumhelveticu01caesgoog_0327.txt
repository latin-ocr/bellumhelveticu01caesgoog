word. Sometimes it is omitted altogether, but is supplied in thought.

260. Dum, modo, and dummodo are used with the subjunctive in
· the sense ol is only, provided thot. Notico that although these seem like
conditione the construction is not the¹same, for the subjunctive is always
used, and the negative is often ne. This is because the construction
originally meant only let (him coma-I will, etc), and the mode is the sub·
junctive oi desire (184, o). Examples: magno me metri liberabis dum·
modo murus intersit (Cic. Oat. I, 10), you will rid mc of much feurif
only lbere be (only let lbere be) o wall between asmodeus (or non) discedat
eum videbe, is only he do not leave I shall see blm.
