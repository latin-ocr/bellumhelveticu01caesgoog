65. The principal parts are forms which show to which conjugaticn
a verb belongs and what each of its stems is. They are, in the active,
(1) the first person singular p‘resent indicative (as the first form of the
verb), (2) the present infinitive (to indicate the conjugation and give
the present stem), (3) the first person singular perfect indicative (to
give the perfect stem), (4) the supine (to give the supine stem). The
supine of the majority oi verbs is'not found in Latin literature, so that
other forms ci the verb are often given instead of the supine. But no
one form is found for every verb, and it is simpler to give the supine
always.
ι In the passive the principal parts are (1) the first person singular
present indicative, (2) the present infinitivo, (3) the first person singu·
lar perfect indicative.
