oiation. This may nothe deemed advisahle by all teachers; but
it is urged, as essential to entire thorouglmess‚ that the student
become so familiar with the text that he can give the English
for the Latin or the Latin for the English when pronounced by
the teacher. The text of the twenty-nine chapterS, given con-
nectedly after the lessonS, will be found convenient for reviews.
' Second: Immediately after the text of each lesson, the mean-
ing of the Latin words, as they ocem in the order of the text, is
given in English, and the student should be required to give both
the English equivalent for the Latin and the Latin for the Eng-
lish as pronounoed by the teaoher. Each vocabulary contains an
entirely new set of words. It is expected that the pupil will
thoroughly master the words of each lesson, so that he will
recognize them as they occur again and again iu the text. This
saves the time of the student-often vested in repeatedly look-
ing up the same word—strengthens the memory‚ cultivates the
attention, and secures accurate knowledge. The general vocabu·
lary at the end of the book should be unneeessary, except, per-
haps, for words which rarely occur. ,

Third: For the convenience of teaohers, and to give definite
direction to the student's work, the substance of the text is given
in short portione in dictation exercises, which the student is to
be required to translate orally as pronounced by the teacher.
This gives opportunity to vary forms and constructions, fixes the
meaning of wordS, and insures familiarity with the text. The
matter given in these exercises cau easily be modified and ex-
tended at the pleasure of the instructor.

Fourth: The same text is used as the basis for English
sentences to be written in Latin. While the thought of tho
passage is often retained in these sentences, their structure is so
varied from the original as to afford thorough grammatica] drill.

No new words are introduced in this exercise‚ that no time may
be lost in looking them up. This abundant practice, with
Caesaream models fresh in the mind of the student, produces
readiness in Latin composition and a correct style.
