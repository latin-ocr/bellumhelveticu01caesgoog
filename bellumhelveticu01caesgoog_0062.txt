I. Recite and translate the entire text of the first chapter.

This chapter is the general geographical introduction to Caesar's narra
tive oi his extraordinary campaigns in Gaul. Such a chapter was especially
necessa1y at the time he wrote, because the Romans then knew almost notu-
ing of the geography ol Gaul, except the parts nearest to Italy and the
Mediterranean. Gaul was to thern only a vast unknown country whose
inhabitants had once taken and sacked Rome, and had several tirnes de-
feated Roman armies with feariul slaughter. If the student has not yet
mastered the general outlines oi its geography he should do so now with the
aid oi this chapter and the map on page 26. Note especially the position oi
the Helvetians and what Caesar has to say of thern; for it is with them that
the narrative is now most concerned. Read pages 12 and 13.

11. Review the vocabularies in 87 and 121.
